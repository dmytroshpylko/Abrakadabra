Hi Sara.
Sorry, I have read you letter, but I haven't free time for reply.
Today I do my work early and i can write to you.

Let's start about Dave. I completely understand your situation. I really think,
you should speak to Hilary and explain her that Dave spends too much time at our house. 

Dave shouldn't come to her house, when hostess absent at house. He can go to house just
when Hilary is at home. So, you should explain to Hillary that she lives at this house not
single, and her boyfriend must respect another's person space in room and things too. 

What about your promotion. On the work, you must been independent and certain. You decision 
must be correct and strong for everybody and also for Dave. Anyway, he isn't must feel light relations from you.

I understand, if you get new job, you should do the more work. More works equals more money, so i think this is good for everyone. 
But you don't should forget about free time for relax, hooby and self-perfection. Last, is very important in our time.

Best wishes, Dima.
